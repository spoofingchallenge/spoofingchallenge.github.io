<h3>Introducation</h2>

<p>
Do you have a method/algorithm to discriminate between human and synthetic speech (generated from speech synthesis or voice conversion systems)?
If so, you are invited to take part in the Anti-Spoofing Challenge.

<p>The objective of Anti-Spoofing Challenge is to benchmark and compare novel ideas in the detection of spoofing attacks with a standard database,
protocol and metric. In all previous research, anti-spoofing techniques also known as countermeasures have been developed with full knowledge of
a single or small number of spoofing attacks. This initiative is to help break this mould and to support, for the first time, 
independent assessments of vulnerabilities to spoofing and of countermeasure 
performance without prior knowledge of spoofing attacks.

<p>You will be provide with a spoofing database along with a protocol for experiments. The spoofing database
is generated from more than ten voice conversion and speech synthesis spoofing techniques. Your task is to develop a classifier/detector 
 on the development data to deal with some known spoofing attacks, and then apply your classifier or system 
on a evaluation data with both known attacks and some unknown attacks. Your classifier or system is expected to be reliable to both known and 
unknown attacks. <b>No prior knowledge of automatic speaker verification technology is required to participat the challenge!</b>

<p>Results of the Challenge will be disseminated at a Special Session of <a href="http://interspeech2015.org/">Interspeech 2015</a>.

<h3>Getting the data</h3>

<p>All the participants can download the spoofing database used in the challenge for free. The database can be accessed via <a href="http://data.cstr.ed.ac.uk/antispoofing2015/">http://data.cstr.ed.ac.uk/antispoofing2015/</a>.</p>

<p>To get the username and password for downloading, as well as more detailed instructions, please send a request to <a href="mailto:zhizheng.wu@ed.ac.uk">Zhizheng Wu</a>. </p>

<p>After downloading the files, you can use the MD5 checksum to verify your downloads: 0ebe54ceef0f20709bfc15d30d5e1a37</p>

<p>There is a mailing list for discussion for the challenge. Participants can also request a membership of the mailing list when they are requesting the username and password.</p>
<h3>Background information</h3>
You could get some background information on spoofing and anti-spoofing from the survey paper: 

<p> Zhizheng Wu, Nicholas Evans, Tomi Kinnunen, Junichi Yamagishi, Federico Alegre, Haizhou Li, "<b>Spoofing and countermeasures for speaker verification: a survey</b>", Speech Communication, Volume 66, Pages 130â€“153, 2015 [<a href="http://www.zhizheng.org/papers/specom_survey_2014.pdf">PDF</a>]
