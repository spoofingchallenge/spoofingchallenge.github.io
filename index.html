<h3>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Do you have a method/algorithm to discriminate between human and synthetic speech (generated from speech synthesis or voice conversion systems)?
If so, you are invited to take part in the Automatic Speaker Verification
Spoofing and Countermeasures (ASVspoof) Challenge.

<p>Previously, both spoofing attacks and countermeasures have been developed with full knowledge of a particular 
speaker verification system used for vulnerability assessments.  Similarly, countermeasures have been developed 
with full knowledge of the spoofing attack which they are designed to detect.  This is clearly unrepresentative 
on the real use case scenario in which the specific attack, much less the specific algorithm, can never been known a priori.  
It is thus likely that the prior work  has as much over-exaggerated the threat of spoofing as it has the 
performance of countermeasures. </p>

<p>The ASVspoof challenge has been designed to help break this mould and to support, 
for the first time, independent assessments of vulnerabilities to spoofing and of countermeasure performance.  
While preventing as much as possible the inappropriate use of prior knowledge, the challenge aims 
to stimulate the development of generalised countermeasures with potential to detect varying and unforeseen spoofing attacks. </p>

<p>The first evaluation, ASVspoof 2015, is being held within the scope of a special session at INTERSPEECH 2015 
and with a focus on spoofing detection.  Participants are invited to submit spoofing detection results. 
You will be provide with a spoofing database along with a protocol for experiments. The spoofing database
is generated from more than ten voice conversion and speech synthesis spoofing techniques. Your task is 
to develop a classifier/detector 
 on the development data to deal with some known spoofing attacks, and then apply your classifier or system 
on a evaluation data with both known attacks and some unknown attacks. Your classifier or system is expected to be 
reliable to both known and 
unknown attacks. <b>No prior knowledge of automatic speaker verification technology is required to participate in the challenge!</b>

<p><b><a href="http://www.spoofingchallenge.org/asvSpoof.pdf">Evaluation plan</a>:</b> Details of the evaluation plan can be access through this document: <a href="http://www.spoofingchallenge.org/asvSpoof.pdf">http://www.spoofingchallenge.org/asvSpoof.pdf</a></p>

<p>Results of the Challenge will be disseminated at a Special Session of <a href="http://interspeech2015.org/">Interspeech 2015</a>.

<h3>Getting the data</h3>

<p>The spoofing database is freely-available to all participants, please follow the following steps to get the data:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Please send a request to <a href="mailto:zhizheng.wu@ed.ac.uk">Zhizheng Wu</a> (zhizheng.wu@ed.ac.uk) to get an username and a password. Please indicate your institute in the email.</li>
  <li>Go to this webpage: <a href="http://data.cstr.ed.ac.uk/antispoofing2015/">http://data.cstr.ed.ac.uk/antispoofing2015/</a></li>
  <li>Enter your username and password as requested by above webpage</li>
  <li>Download 'ASVspoof2015_development.tar.gz', the size of the file is 5865596645 bytes</li>
  <li>Use the md5 checksum to verify your downloads: 0cdc334767cae92c541f220be650ef48</li>
  
</ol>

<p>There is a mailing list for discussion for the challenge. Participants can also request a membership of the mailing list when they are requesting the username and password. Anyone who is interested in this topic but does not want to participant in the challenge, you can also request membership of the mailing list by send an email to Zhizheng Wu.</p>

<h3>Background information</h3>
You could get some background information on spoofing and anti-spoofing from the survey paper:
