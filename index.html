<h3>Purpose</h2>


<p>This initiative follows on from the first special session in spoofing and countermeasures 
for automatic speaker verification held at INTERSPEECH 2013.  
The vision behind that first edition was to promote the consideration of spoofing 
and the development of countermeasures, and to form a new community of researchers 
to organise the collection and distribution of standard databases, protocols and metrics.  
This work is now complete.

<p>In all previous research, countermeasures have been developed with full knowledge 
of a single or small number of spoofing attacks in addition to full knowledge of the 
particular speaker verification system used for experimentation.  
It is likely that it has both over-exaggerated the threat of spoofing 
in addition to that of countermeasure performance.  The long term vision of the ASVspoof 
initiative is to help break this mould and to support, for the first time, 
independent assessments of vulnerabilities to spoofing and of countermeasure 
performance without prior knowledge of ASV systems or spoofing attacks.

<p>The ASVspoof 2015 special session therefore incorporates an evaluation / challenge with 
a standard database, protocol and metric.  The database is free to registered participant 
who agree to submit to the INTERSPEECH 2015 special session a paper describing their systems, 
experiments and results.  This document describes the database, protocol and metric, 
in addition to general evaluation rule and procedures.
